# JunkFood Delivery (Not ui)
Hello. I created a code that is suitable for begginers in python. In this software, you can become a member in JunkFood Delivery (JFD) and also you can manage menu of foods and prices.
I am writing the UI of this application.
I tried to write the code simply.
The database depends on a data_login.txt file and user passwords datas are saved in JSON file.
